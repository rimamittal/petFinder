245,,18,307,307,3744,"Lucy is a stray female dog I rescued near Kuchai Lama. She is about 1-2 years old. She was very skinny and seemed lost. I wanted to send her to the vet to be spayed but unfortunately, she was already pregnant. She is currently at the vet and will be there until she gives birth. I will bear all the charges for her medical fees and whatever cost at the vet. I also plan to vaccinate and have her neutered when the time is right. I hope to find a good home for her and her future pups. Vet said she cannot be spayed until at least 1 month after she gives birth. Lucy is very good natured, friendly, affectionate and smart. She loves people. She understands ""sit"" after a few attempts and without much training. I believe she has lots of potential and will be a very good companion dog. Please contact me directly or contact me via email, if you wish to adopt her or any of her future pups. I sincerely believe she deserves a chance and a loving home. Thanks.

Please, please, please be a responsible dog owner and neuter or spay them as soon as they are old enough to undergo the procedure when they are 4 months or older. There are too many unwanted strays and puppies out there and most do not get a chance in life and are put down. Local dogs are also very resilient and intelligent and they will guard your house well. But please do not chain or cage them unnecessary for a long periods of time as all dogs need to be able to move around and have their exercise. If you love them, they will love you back even more. UPDATE 10 May : Lucy has just given birth to 7 puppies 2 days ago. They are all up for adoption. She has 6 brown/tan cute puppies (like the color of their mommy) and 1 adorable white (female) one. There are 5 female puppies and 2 male puppies in total. Vet said she can offer a special price for spaying/neutering if you are willing to bring the puppy back to her clinic for the procedure. If you are hesitant to adopt a female puppy or unsure about the cost of spaying, please feel free to contact me and we can discuss or work something out together. Please do not hesitate to inquire if you need more information. You can ""book"" the puppies now if you are really interested. They can be adopted once they are weaned from their mommy at about 6-8 weeks. These puppies need a loving and caring home. If you would like to adopt a loving pet into your home, please consider these puppies. Thanks! UPDATE 15 May : Vet said Lucy is taking care of her puppies very well. She is a very good mommy. On closer oservation, there are 2 dark coffee colored puppies, 2 latte puppies, 2 tan puppies (like their mommy) and 1 white puppy. The tiniest puppy of the lot (tan) is also a female. UPDATE 26 MAY : Puppies are about 18 days old now and their eyes are opened already :) Very cute and chubby! One sad news, vet called today to inform me that the tiniest one has passed away. She did not make it because she was wounded unintentionally by one of her siblings, too weak and didn't really want to nurse. My heart aches to know this but at least the consolation is that she did not suffer much and has now joined other beloved pets at 'rainbow bridge'. Farewell little miss tiny. UPDATE 31 MAY : Lucy and her puppies are still at the vet's clinic. Lucy is not trained but I believe she is smart enough and has a lot of potential. Some people have asked what kind of ""mixed breed"" Lucy and her pups are. Lucy is actually a local dog (the common kind) and her size is slightly smaller than a medium framed dog. Since I am unsure about the pups' father, I would assume it was another local dog as well. If you would like more information, please contact me directly.

I( Norbert) paid for all the medical costs which were naturally quite high but that is ok as long as somebody could take her in and give her a home.

405,,24,307,307,1346,"Dear friends, Please let me introduce you to our good friend Black. For several months now, my wife and I are looking after this lovely male dog which is “residing” at the beach volleyball field behind the hockey stadium in Bukit Jalil. When we first met Black, he was doing fine. He was looked after by the security guard at the place and Black in return did some occasional work by assisting the guard in his duties. For some undisclosed reason however, someone decided to turn the quite and nice area into a new to build car park. From that time, Black is in trouble. They took away his shelter and subsequently they terminated the services of the security guard, leaving Black with no place to stay and nobody to look after him. Several times per week my wife and I are feeding him, bathing him and see that he is alright but we noticed that the place becomes more and more invaded by more stray dogs who are chasing and harassing Black. The reason for this is that Black is used to humans and therefore in some way social and friendly, giving other dogs the chance to dominate him. At the moment he is under the professional care of Dr. See and his team in Sri Petaling for a severe infected wound at his back. Black don’t deserves this! If you have any idea or solution, please contact me on my mobile phone Hope for the best.Norbert Mohnen",1,0,1,1,2,7,1,0.0,2,Blacki,1,1,87db66a72,1,1,290,0.0,41326,0,3,1,1,0,249,64,1,1,0,1,1,1,black,no color,no color,0,1,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.0,0.63999996,8.0,0.6102368,0.7164636,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.75423436,0.545928,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.70899312,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.7585648,0.0,0.0,dogdog breeddog like mammaldog breed groupstreet dogformosan mountain dogsnoutpatterdale terrieraustralian kelpierare breed dog,grey,darkslategrey,black,mixed breed,mixed breed,0,0,0,0,0

We've taken her to the vet and she had to get her tail docked due to a wound caused by a rubber-band that was tied there for too long. She has also been dewormed, but NOT vaccinated yet as she's too young. According to the vets, Caramel is about 8-weeks old. We'd love to keep her, but we just took in another male puppy 3-weeks ago, and since we live in a townhouse-style building we can't handle another pup at the moment. Right now the only way to keep things under control is to keep her in a cage, and we hate to see her cooped up all day. She's an absolute sweetheart and deserves to be with a loving family.

478,,2,254,0,1299,"She's a very very affectionate kitten. She lost her mother who died and is very affection starved. She will love you and request frequent cuddles. She is a stray but otherwise is eating and sleeping well. She needs more attention that most cats because of the death of her mother at such a young age. I found her near my home area mewing away for someone to love her. She was bullied by the larger cats around the area too which is why we took her in. We would love to keep her but our kitten doesn't like her very much. We feel she really deserves a good home with a loving family to look after her. She is heartbreakingly adorable. Conditions for adoption: 1. Kittens to be spayed/neutered when they are 5-6 months. Those who are interested to adopt the kittens MUST commit to spaying or neutering them when they reach minimum age because this is the only way to control our stray cat population. 2. Ensure regular vaccinations as per your vet's advise, and medical attention when necessary. 3. To be willing to provide regular updates on their progress until they are spayed/neutered.

561,,22,264,276,1597,"18 May - Eve, have found her forever home. TQ. Read up to the end before you respond. Eve is a stray roaming at my home. She has given birth at least once. I am not sure where she took her babies to but she comes back now and again. She is extremely weary and obsessively afraid of people and other aggressive cats. But she will meow you like crazy for food. I started feeding her and managed to catch her for spaying and was well taken care of 2 weeks after surgery. I released her after the stitches were taken out by the vet 2 weeks after surgery. As you can see now without having to get pregnant every 3 months and with daily feeding, she is very very healthy and has a pretty coat (even if she still roams as a stray). Can you imagine with proper care, she will be an absolute beauty!! So I am thinking with the right owner, I believe she can be rehabilitate to be a home pet. As I am allergic to cats, I can only feed her and not pet her or play with her. I hope to find her a loving and patient owner as I know she can learn not to be afraid of human touch. But you must be experienced cat owner and have the patient to deal with such cat. Of course, Eve is a special case and I must be updated on her progress constantly. Only suitable people should call. Do not SMS, whatsapp, I do not have time to reply. If you meet all the criteria above & below, then call us. 1. Must be experienced and a true cat lover 2.

712,,2,307,0,823,"Cinnamon (male) is one of the eight puppies born in our apartment car park. His mother is a young mixed-breed who appeared out of the blue in our apartment premises about a year ago. I assume she had been abandoned by her owner as she seems to be a very human-oriented dog.

713,,2,307,0,1313,"Caraway (female) is one of the eight puppies born in our apartment car park at the end of Sep. My neighbors and I have managed to find homes for most of them; however, Caraway and her sister Nutmeg had been taken away by someone and left at a coffee shop near our apartment, apparently waiting for construction workers to pick them up. Fortunately, the owner of the coffee shop is another animal lover and she refused to hand them over to the construction workers. Nonetheless, the coffee shop owner agreed to let her employee have Caraway and she was with the worker for a few weeks until the worker realized that she couldn't handle Caraway anymore. So we managed to bring her back a few days ago and one of my neighbors is currently fostering her. (In the meanwhile, we managed to bring Caraway's sister Nutmeg back from the coffee shop a few weeks ago and successfully rehomed her last week.) She is now eight-week old and has grown up quite a bit since I posted her pictures at the end of Oct. She has turned out to be a very active, smart and pretty girl!

714,,6,307,141,973,"Cocoa the chocolate lab mix appeared in our apartment compound at the end of March. Apparently, this incredibly friendly adorable sweet boy was abandoned by his heartless previous owner. Unfortunately, some residents are complaining about his presence and threatening to call dog catchers as we already have two resident strays on the premises. He is young (7-8 months?) and healthy (about 17kg as at 12 Apr ), and amazingly great with any humans and dogs. While he generally seems pretty gentle and obedient, being a teenager, he has boundless energy and loves to play with other dogs (and humans), and he is most likely to grow quite big at maturity. So we hope that he is adopted by an active family who can engage him in various activities and/or a family who currently has a relatively young active dog(s) who longs for a playmate/companion.

He would find shelter under cars and very few people fed him, which was why he was thin & hungry all the time. He kept trying to follow people home but no one would let him in. But as luck would have it, someone took pity on him and decided to rescue him. A vet check showed that he's a young boy, 4 months old at most. He's been Frontlined for ticks & fleas and also de-wormed. Vet says he's a healthy boy at 8kg and most likely will grow up to be medium-large around kg. Mocha is possibly a mix of Belgian or German shepherd - based on his face and also the blue spots on his tongue. However, his body and fur is that of a terrier. Mocha is a very smart dog. He doesn't dirty the house and prefers to poo & pee at grassy patches. He will keep jumping or looking at the gate if he needs to go. He doesn't bark unnecessarily, only when it's really important. In fact, he managed to foil an attempted house break-in by barking very loudly when someone tried to enter the fosterer's opposite neighbour's house. He also gets along with his fosterer's male dog and is friendly to humans too. Mocha is more suitable for houses, preferably with a grassy patch for toileting. As he is still a puppy, adopters must understand that he will go through a chewing phase as his puppy teeth changes to adult teeth. Hence adopters should buy rawhides and chew toys. Adoption fee of RM50 is to cover vet bills, food as well as a donation to an animal shelter. Adopters must also sign an adoption form and agree to follow-up home visits, if necessary.

When she's adjusted to her home, she barks at strangers - a strong healthy bark!",1,0,2,2,1,4,1,0.0,2,Co Co,1,3,93f2c9ee0,8,1,2164,0.0,41326,0,1,1,1,0,103,27,15,1,0,1,1,0,black,brown,cream,0,1,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21.8,1.75999989,22.0,0.112456786,2.003314146,0.0,0.7248395000000001,0.0,0.0,2.068951826,0.691464932,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.9916417800000001,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.151360832,0.0,0.0,dogdog breeddog like mammaldog breed groupnative american indian dogking shepherdshiloh shepherd dogutonaganicelandic sheepdogcarnivoran,tan,bisque,rosybrown,german shepherd dog,spitz,0,0,0,0,0

The kindly lady fed her and gave her shelter while another neighbourhood rescuer sent Happy to be spayed. When Happy first appeared, she was scared and frightened of humans, also thin & scrawny. But under the care of her fosterer and rescuer, she has grown to be a beautiful and loving dog. Happy can get along with dogs - male and female - as well as humans. She is a very good watch dog - only barks when there are strangers. Most of the other times, she is quiet and doesn't give trouble at all. Her fosterer already has 2 dogs and is unable to care for a 3rd one long-term. Hence, I am helping to find Happy another home. I've observed Happy to be an easy dog to care for. She is trained to do her toileting on grass, but adopters can also train her to do on newspapers. Happy is medium-size and approximately 18kg. Please call for viewing.

Cookie loves to cuddle, to get belly rubs and playing catch-the-balls. She's a great walking companion and loves to go on long walks with people. She was brought to Gasing Animal Hospital and given a clean bill of health, but has not been spayed. She has been vaccinated, dewormed, and is currently on Heartguard.

Cookie will only be released to a responsible owner who is committed to looking after her for the rest of her life. A home inspection (within the Klang Valley) will probably be necessary.

794,,2,299,0,1391,"Meet Charlie the (Monkey) Cat! Charlie is a male, tabby short-hair estimated to be around 2-3 months old. He's extremely friendly with everyone, including the doctor (although he didn't really like getting his temperature taken). He's gotten his first vaccination shot but will have to wait a bit before getting neutered. Charlie is quite easy to handle in the bath and comes out looking like a funny kitty version of Dobby the House Elf. He has a bit of a Donald Duck sort of voice which is quite unique. He's quite proud that his voice sounds like a famous cartoon character. He does well with small dogs (he really likes following his big sister around) and he will follow any human who comes into view and catches his attention. He's curious about bigger dogs but he doesn't enjoy being lunged at by excitable ones. He's a very laid back fellow who's fine with other cats as long as they're fine with him. Charlie can't quite decide what he wants to be when he grows up. He loves playing football and he loves adventuring like Indiana Jones and exploring new nooks and crannies. He also likes climbing and perching on high spots like a ninja monkey. Ideally, he would love to be a professional football-playing-ninja-monkey-adventurer cat when he grows up.

He has a very expressive tail with a little kink at the tip. He's not too fond of dogs and isn't comfortable around other unknown cats and really just prefers people of all shapes and sizes. His favorite sport seems to be chasing his shadow and string, and he loves curling up and falling asleep on a nice warm lap. He's also litter box trained!

I sent them to vet to check on their health, the vet advised me to return them to the vet after a period of time to do the necessary checking. Their name was given during the first visit to veterinary, the white colour kitten named as Snowy, she is the eldest among them, she is brave, playful, and like to being with human.

1226,,12,307,103,3381,"From the rescuer (Chia-Yi): ""I have an emergency case here of a stray being abused, bound and thrown into a garbage bin. The students from my college called me on Sunday morning to help rescue the dog about a year old doggie, his name is Potato (Cantonese). My students said that the dog is very good natured, very playful and protective of the girls, they took care of him since he was a pup where they hid him from the MPPP that shot and killed Potato’s mum. My students told me someone beat up and threw bleached at him and his eyes were all inflamed before CNY. Before that, there have been incidents where someone tied a plastic bag over his head and people threw hot water at him. And the worse was on Saturday night, they found Potato tied up with a snooze made from fishing line, thrown into the big garbage bin but some auntie came and told the students about the incident and my students climbed into the bin to save him. Because of lack of blood circulation from the snooze, his paws were all swollen and his neck too. He was very lucky my students saved him in time and they took care of him the whole night. I cannot imagine how evil some people can be! Monsters!!!!! I just can’t stop crying to think that this doggie was so badly treated by those ‘animals’ Potato deserves a better life than being tortured… My students can’t keep Potato because they are only renting rooms and the landlady was so mad, she threatened to call the M.P.P.P to come kill Potato on Monday. My students couldn’t stop crying because they will have to go back to their hometowns for the semester break and were afraid that the landlady will hurt Potato so they have asked me to help, I took Potato home. However the house that I've placed the puppies at, my friend’s parents found out and my friend backed out on loaning out his compound (eventhough it’s vacant!) and I have no place to house Potato by end of next week. Fortunately my cousin said he could put Potato in a cage in one of the store rooms but only for like max early next month. Taking him to S.P.C.A is not an option because after what he has been through, I would never take him there and I’m hoping someone good can adopt him. Potato is a wonderful dog, I’ve played with him these few days, we go for walks (I have to tie all my other dogs up, they are very aggressive towards him) and Potato is so loving, at first he was weary but then now he seems better and more willing to trust me and I can’t stop crying on how cruel and evil people can be to treat a sweet dog like him that way… We would give him all the immunity shots by next week at the vet because he had maggots on him from wounds and my vet gave him vitamin, calcium and antibiotic shots on Monday. I hope if you could help please please try to find someone to adopt Potato? I really hope he could find a loving owner because he deserves that after all that he has been through. I really would like to keep him but because I have so many dogs, they don’t respond well to another male dog and knowing Potato’s past, I know I can’t possibly give him a good loving home by being overwhelmed and I’m afraid that he will be badly bullied by my dogs here. I’m just so tired with human nature and their mentality of hurting innocent animals such as Potato."" For those who is interested to adopt Potato or able to give him a loving home, please contact Chia Ling at.",1,0,1,1,1,5,1,0.0,2,Abused Dog Looking For A Home,1,2,a6b8c7aec,4,1,2717,0.0,41327,2,2,1,1,0,644,31,1,1,0,0,1,1,black,brown,no color,0,1,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,1.11999993,14.0,0.5009713600000001,1.2502244,0.0,0.503566598,0.0,0.0,1.320040306,1.0381727920000001,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2060679859999999,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3667382900000002,0.0,0.0,dogdog breeddog breed groupdog like mammalkunming wolfdogsnoutgerman shepherd dogstreet dograre breed dogcarnivoran,darkslategrey,darkolivegreen,black,mixed breed,german shepherd dog,0,1,0,0,0

1242,,1,307,189,829,"A good Samaritan has written to us asking for help. She has recently rescued a pregnant mother dog who later on gave birth to 10 puppies. She will be spaying the mother dog soon enough but she just could not cope with the 10 puppies. She is appealing for public help to adopt the puppies.

Please understand that you will be asked plenty of questions before confirmation. Thanks for your patience and time in advance. ATTENTION ADOPTERS (IMPORTANT) **Conditions** - Prefer working adults to support food, medical expenses and other necessities. - If possible, a home with an existing senior cat (that is also SPAYED/NEUTERED) - Please ask permission from the people around you and receive their consent before adopting. - Kitten will be personally sent to your home if conditions allow. Adopters are REQUIRED to update progress as often as possible especially during the first few months. You will also be given probation to see if they fit your personality. If not, kindly call and return the kitten to us. - Proactive adopters will be given priority, meaning, good-hearted ones that provides as much information to all the questions asked. I will need to personally speak to you via phone/in person. **** Please provide details about yourself such as; Name, Age, Work Status (working/studying, local/international), hometown, experiences with pet (if none, research and explain), your house type, family members, your reasons to adopt (MOST IMPORTANT), your knowledge to care for kittens. - Reminder that there is an adoption fee of RM80 to cover some of her expenses. - Interested adopters should atleast have cage and litter pan ready for her. Will explain reasons if interested. - Kitten is currently too young for any vaccinations or procedures, therefore she must be contained from other cats. Vaccination is required to prevent any disease or infection. First, it will be done monthly and then ANNUALLY. Spaying is also a MUST to prevent any further unwanted litters when she reaches 5 months old. Deworming is also just as important. As of now, she has been dewormed on 13 July . Remember, adopting is a commitment. Pets are not substitutes and will never be for they are all equal and different beings, bearing their very own unique personalities. Do not adopt if you are expecting them to replace someone or an old pet. Kittens will grow up, make messes and trouble, you will need to be willing to sacrifice time, energy and support her financially throughout her life for the next 15 YEARS. They will, however, return our love and care equally and with so many more extras. If you are serious about adopting a family member and you are willing to spend time, money and effort to take care of the kitten, then, by all means, contact me.",1,80,1,2,1,6,1,0.0,1,Baby (no Fixed Name),1,3,276502657,11,1,4657,0.0,41326,0,2,2,2,0,438,2,2,1,1,0,1,1,brown,cream,white,1,1,0,0,0.18839662000000001,0.8,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,27.8,2.27999987,28.0,0.0,0.12899552,1.5873854120000002,0.11026288000000001,2.393864522,2.32311323,0.1610397,1.139841738,2.2169161319999997,1.772010008,0.0,0.166344952,0.662978672,2.016751742,1.0297314700000002,0.0,0.0,2.5784429099999997,catsmall to medium sized catscat like mammalwhiskersdomestic short haired catkittenaegean catsnouteuropean shorthairsingapura,dimgrey,sienna,saddlebrown,domestic short hair,domestic short hair,1,1,0,0,0

1406,,120,207,0,2276,"This dog was found wandering in a housing area in Kepong Baru on 1/1/11. Hence, the name Yat Yat (meaning 'one one' in Cantonese). Based on the dog's condition when it was found, it was believed to have been abandoned by its heartless owner. The dog suffered from a severe inflammation of the ear where the ear canals are almost completely closed. It also has mange. This obviously neglected dog was sent to the vet for treatment and is currently under the care of my uncle. However, my uncle is only willing to foster it for about a month. Therefore, if I am not able to find an adopter before the deadline, I would have to put this poor dog to sleep. This is the last thing that I want to do as this dog is really well-behaved, very friendly and seemed so innocent, not knowing what its future would be. Yat yat is also partially blind due to cataract. Despite this, he still looks very happy with its life, wagging its tail whenever he hears someone (anyone) nearby although he cannot see. He would also reach his hand out and try to touch us although it doesn't know exactly where we are. I hope that a true animal lover who is willing to care for this dog with all his/her heart would adopt this lovely dog. Yat Yat had suffered enough to have fall into the hands of such owner. Hopefully, its next owner would be a much better one. If you think you are that person, kindly contact me asap! Thank u! ** Yat Yat would be passed to the new owner once it has fully recovered from the otitis (inflammation of the ear) and mange. Here are some details about Yat Yat after I got to know him:- LIKES - a small little house with cozy blanket (so my uncle made him a little house with a cardboard box. He stays in there most of the time) - canned food (can also mix dog biscuit with canned food) - marking territory (lifts up his leg to pee although his tank is already empty) - wrestle with the rug or anything soft (e.g. soft toy) - to play tug-of-war - humping people's legs (can be distracted by giving him the rug to wrestle with) DISLIKES - being caged up (he's pretty quiet when allowed to roam free BUT once he is in a cage or chained up, he will start to protest by barking loudly) ** So preferably no caging! ** - rabbits (he bit my rabbit but luckily no serious injury)",2,0,3,1,2,8,0,0.0,1,Yat Yat,1,3,8825893db,14,1,6986,0.0,41401,1,2,1,2,0,434,54,38,1,0,1,1,1,black,brown,gray,0,1,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,32.6,2.71999983,34.0,0.0,3.021183588,0.0,1.9358419020000004,0.0,0.0,2.98729188,0.6689187600000001,0.0,0.0,0.13562708,1.7970321500000002,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.093979856,0.0,0.0,dogdog like mammaldog breedvertebratedog clothesyorkshire terrieraustralian silky terriersnoutterriercarnivoran,dimgrey,darkolivegreen,darkslategrey,silky terrier,not_recognized,1,0,0,0,0

The dog has a broken jaw and the vet has no idea how long he has been having this broken jaw because when the surgery was scheduled, they realised that there were no more bones to be reunited.

1511,,6,266,266,2128,"1. Lhakyi (Male) I was rescued by a kind lady when my hind leg was seriously injured when I was about 3 to 4 weeks old. My vet said my hind leg couldn't be saved despite they did their best, so my hind leg got amputated. After the surgery I came to live with this fosterer, who's my Slave. Although I have lost my hind leg, that didn't deter me from me being the usual kitten. Just 1 day after the surgery I was back to chasing other cats, mosquitoes and climbing high places. I am quite independent. I love my adopted sister Nera, she's like my mother. She keeps me company and always give me lots of TLC and we wrestle a lot. I am 6 months old now, I have no fleas, no worms, desexed ( here ppl call I kena sunat: P) and I'm a very well behaved boy. I am not fussy. I love some TLC's before you go to bed at night, if you forget I'll make sure to remind you by climbing up on you and demand till you give me some love.Please don't think I'm handicapped, treat me just like other cats with 4 legs cause I'm just as good as the 4 legged. 2. Nera (Female) Hi, I'm Nera. I was the 1st one to arrive at this Slave's place. Someone just dropped me at the middle of the highway one day and a nice and kind lady spotted me and took me home. She was looking for someone to look after me till I was ready for a new family. I am very close to Lhakyi. he was just a baby when he came to me. I looked after him like a big sister. We play a lot and also a lot of wrestling. it keeps us fit and healthy. I also have a nick-name, Black Beauty coz, I have a very soft, black shiny fur and a long tail to match. I am as fast as a lightning, even Superman wouldn't be able to compete with me. During free time, I wrestle, or groom Lhakyi and my Slave. I killed lots of gecko's (Cicaks) in my home. I hate to see dust balls, so I'll help you keep your home clean. I am 6 months old, flea free, worm free and desexed (Spayed). I'm looking for a loving home who will love both me and Lhakyi equally. I love to be cuddled so give me lots of cuddles.

Basically I have blue eyes but my left eye is half blue, half green :D Pretty unique isn't it? My foster mom and vet say I'm a very special kitty. I've done all my vaccinations and I also have a Medical Passport which has all my details. I hope I'm a special kitty to find a loving home too.Oh btw, I respond to the name ""Twinkle""",1,0,2,2,1,5,0,0.0,2,Twinkle,2,2,f575cb059,4,1,5220,0.0,41401,1,2,2,1,0,178,21,3,1,0,0,1,1,gray,white,no color,0,1,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.0,1.15999994,14.0,0.0,0.0,0.7895852600000001,0.13910908600000002,1.291769778,1.267815458,0.0,0.61719234,1.164793264,1.036428292,0.0,0.17610162000000001,0.0,0.946733472,0.12624064,0.0,0.0,1.390226076,catsmall to medium sized catscat like mammalwhiskersdomestic short haired cateyeaegean catburmillakittensnout,grey,darkslategrey,lavender,domestic medium hair,not_recognized,0,0,0,0,0

Later that morning just as i'm about to leave for work it crawled up my car AGAIN but this time i couldn't see it. she was so deep inside the exhaust we had to get a mechanic's help. After awhile, we got her out but she ran AGAIN! but this time she went straight into the deep drain. My father decided to just leave her there and made me go to work without taking her out. Later my sister came back and heard her meowing and went straight into the dirty drain and saved its life :) now..its stuck with us ahahah.

They have been taken to the vet and the vet prescribed a fungal cream and shampoo. Ginger's fur will grow back again once he feels safe and secure. Whitey's fungal infection will get better with the fungal treatment. They are very loving and litter trained. Please adopt them together as Ginger might be stressful without Whitey. Ginger dan Whitey dijumpai di warung pada bulan August yang lalu. Adik beradik ini telah di adopt lebih kurang 2 1/2 bulan yang lalu. Walaubagaimanapun mereka dipulangkan kepada saya oleh adopter kerana masalah kesihatan (adik adopter ada asthma). Mereka berdua tidak dijaga dengan elok kerana bulu Ginger sekarang gugur kerana stress dan Whitey pula belakangnya ada fungal. Mereka telah dibawa ke vet dan telah mendapat rawatan dengan krim dan shampoo. Bulu Ginger akan tumbuh semula bila dia rasa stabil dan selamat. Fungal infection Whitey akan sembuh dengan menggunakan krim dan shampoo. Mereka sangat penyayang dan boleh menggunakan pasir. Tolong adopt mereka berdua kerana Ginger akan stress tanpa Whitey.,1,0,2,3,2,5,0,0.0,1,Ginger And Whitey,1,2,6bcde41ce,6,2,6290,0.0,41401,1,1,2,1,0,225,43,3,1,0,0,1,1,golden,white,no color,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,18.0,1.43999991,18.0,0.0,0.13440680000000002,0.0,0.9692792600000001,1.66160442,1.60761068,0.17673114,0.0,1.5242441480000002,0.9761370840000001,0.0,0.182893872,0.8522992,1.1962517400000001,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.7828817900000002,catwhiskersmammalsmall to medium sized catscat like mammalfaunakittencarnivorandomestic short haired catfur,peru,sienna,sienna,domestic medium hair,not_recognized,0,0,0,0,0

1729,,10,307,0,2410,"Please refer to my Popi pup pup post. Bosch is one of d pup. He has been adopted when he was 2 mths old. Adopter refused to neuter him when he has reached 6 mths old even though they have agreed to do so. I took him back fr d adopter on 26/3, and pup has been neutered on 27/3/18. Today is his 1st day back to my hse after 5 mths away. He still remember to pee on newspaper even though d adopter let him pee & poo all over their car porch. Overall he is very hyper, wearing d ecollar & banging everything along d way. He doesn't know d basic command like Sit ! I will have alot of works to train him ! If u r looking for a pet to spent time with, consider Bosch, gv him ur time n efforts, he will gv u his life of loyalty & love. day 2. Noticed that he barks really Loud ! He can be tie to a chain but if u leave him, he will starts barking. A bit of improvement today, he will sit as I commanded him to before I release him fr the chain. Day 3. He doesn't want to eat his kibbles, keep disturbing me while i serving my home cook meal to my dogs. I just didnt gv in and after an hr, he finally ate all d kibbles. Only after that i gv him d home cook meal. Day 4. Will sit immediately when i command him to. At one point during d day, I tie him up coz I need to in & out fr d back door (if not he will run out), not long after being tied, he felt asleep ! That trigger me d thought of maybe previous adopter used to tie him up long hours, so he got used to sleeping with d chain on ! Haaai ...... Poor boy. Day 5 to day 8. Now he will finished d kibbles fast n then wait for rice, he got it. I carried him like a baby this afternoon, hint legs rest on d side of my waist, he likes it. I can understand y he always barks when I hv to leave him, maybe he wants accompany, he has separation anxiety 😅 I lost count of d days 😝. Anyway, he loves to take a bath, not afraid of water at all. I used just 1 day to train him to go into d cage willing (by using a treat to lured him), not bad at all, smart boy. Whenever I need to wash d floor, I'll put him in d cage n he will quietly stay in there, sometimes fall asleep in there while waiting for me to finish up washing. He feel secure to sleep in d cage. Update : I don't hv to scream my heart out to ask him to sit down, just show hand sign n he will sit already.

1733,,7,307,0,1098,"Please ref to my Popi Pup Pup post. He is one of the baby that was born on 8.8.. His name Guai Lan means naughty in Hokkien dialect. i named him Guai Lan because he is the only one gets angry very fast when comes to playing with each other and when i wipe his body everynight ! We as Hokkien, we believe naming someone that would change him to the opposite way (so by naming him 'naughty' , i hope that he can grow n turn out to be NOT naughty). Anyway, he was adopted last December but returned to me just 2 days ago (11.3.) because the adopter said he is naughty and not obedient. I would put it in the way that a puppy is consider playful, not naughty. And if she wants the puppy to be obedient, she has to spent sometime to train him instead of just left him with the maid. Pup has been send in to the vet right away on 11.3. for check up and the vet has neutered him on the next day 12.3.. He is a very handsome looking boy, active and alert too, which makes him a very good watch dog.

They love to cuddle and sleep with each other (especially in the shoe box). They are very close to each other even though they are not siblings as they've been through tough times together. Therefore, priority will be given to those who are willing to take both together :) Tabby is just a tabby kitten and he's smaller in size. Chubby has a softer and fluffier coat, he seems to be previously owned by a family but was thrown out when they moved. :( I hope this time they can both be adopted by a kind and warm-hearted person into a permanent loving household.

But with lots of tender loving care, this little one bounced back to health almost immediately and showcased such a fiery spirit. She is incredibly playful and fearless. She is loving and adorable too. While she loves to be picked up and cuddled when she wakes from her naps, she spends most of her days playing and exploring. Fingers and toes are her favorite parts of the human body :) I would love to keep her but I already have 2 cats of my own and one of them is getting a little territorial.

Both of them are sisters, very playful, sweet looking and well mannered cats. The reason I am putting for adoption because we are moving out from our current house soon. I am afraid after we left, these two cats will not have a proper shelter and foods. Unfortunately I do not have any latest photos of the 2 cats, below is the description: 1st cat– 1 year old- medium size, love to play and be pampered, has beautiful big black eye and coated with white, black and oranges patches. 2nd cat- blue eyes, short tail, very playful, coated with orange and white patches, little scared of stranger due to constantly bullied by small boys around our housing area. Both the cats are very close to each other after the mother left them, so I would prefer both cats are adopted together rather than separately as it may upset their feeling. These two cats need lots of attention, responsible and caring family to care for them. They can be great companion for you. Vaccinations and neutering/spaying are compulsory for adoption.

The pictures were taken roughly 6 months ago, when he was about a year old. The adopter should be around Malacca as we would like to view the place Rushka will be living in. Also, be prepared to give your experience with handling dogs as Rushka is a young male, and needs some training and discipline, especially concerning food (very greedy, no patience), and grooming.

Now they are healthy and adopt the sis&bro and left raccoon, he is the weakest when I found he almost die. Raccoon take so much time to recover and now he completely heal and energetic. Because he lost mother in early age before a month around 4week I pick they up, dairy stuff like milk, yogurt, cream or cheese become he favorite. He scare of big dog already due to trauma bite by adult dog and like to suck finger thought is mommy nipple. He is most seldom and can be keep in cage, when he noisy only at dinner time like you start give he eat will notice and bark only. Now In middle in train to put leash and suit he to take a walk and need careful shoe he like to chew on it. He gentle toward cat and friendly but sometime will scare new face so need time to suitable new environment. I hope adopter read before msg me, REQUIREMENTS: Take Raccoon to vaccine and deworm and spare your time and must take responsibity 1year to 20 year to take care he until die.

She was very quiet (unlike now she likes talking sometimes) and behave carefully, never come to the kitchen. She is the cleverest cat so far I know. Guai Guai learns the rules very quick. If you do not want her to do so, you just need loudly shout her with no. After one or two times, she knows already. And she was once a stray cat, she never learned to be armed, or laid down on your legs as a baby. Generally she does not like it. After half year training, now before I go to sleep, she usually comes to me and lies down on my belly under the quite for a while. She is also very tolerant, even something she does not like, she still allow you to do without running away or scratch you. She loves to be touched very much. When I get up, she is just rolling around me and I must stroke her. We will move abroad. It will be cold there and we need travel a lot due to new situation. We think it is better for Guai Guai if she stays in Malaysia. She is very shy. And she cannot stay with the other cats (unless the kittens are younger than 1 month). Please keep her indoor before she get familiar with you. And please be a little bit patient because she is shy. And please do not hit her, because she can learn the things so or so, but she has a good memory, so she will never forget. She likes every tasty solid food, but ‘royal canin’ is not suitable for her. She likes fresh chicken chest, but not wet chicken food or cooked chicken. She loves wet fish food, but dry fish snacks is not her favorite. She likes play catch & go, hide & find.

2177,,24,307,0,1672,"Tiger was brought back by a neighbour who stayed a few houses away from us, and he was not taken care of. The person has moved out a couple of months ago, Tiger has since took shelter at the guardhouse and does some patrolling duty with the security guards around our housing area. His name Tiger was given by the guards. Tiger is very protective of those who treat him as a friend. We would love to have him staying around our housing but some people still see Tiger is a threat to them even though he has never caused any harms to anyone. Hence, we are looking for a forever home for him. He was rescued from MPSJ dog pound once and we hope he will not be ended there again (thanks to the guards who informed us he was taken away by MPSJ). 8 best things about Tiger: 1. Alert 2. Protective of his human friends 3. A guard dog who has experience in patrolling with guards 4. Loves chasing squirrels 5. Manja 6. Responsive 7. Has a very charming smile (proven with pictures!) 8. Loves to tag along when we bring our furkids out for evening walks Below are the conditions for adoption if you would like to adopt Tiger as part of your family: 1. No unnecessary tying/caging up 2.

Am not sure what breed her parents were - because she was dumped by someone near a chicken processing factory. Im curious to know how beautiful she is going to become as she grows up. She has a magic in her - in trusting every human being. Unfortunately she doesn’t realize there are a group of people waiting to harm her. She is under the care of a guard uncle at the moment who worries for her safety.

2223,,4,266,0,2861,"Last October, a family of cats moved into a hollow space in my house through a hole. My parents sealed off the hole, without realising that the kittens were still inside. When we finally brought them out, the mother cat took two of the kittens, but left one behind. I took the little kitten, and gave it to my friend for temporary shelter while we try and find her an owner. Sadly, I could not find anyone who would take her in. However, as she was happy with my friend and his family, finding a family wasn't too much of a priority in my life. Especially with my university and visa applications, I eventually stopped asking for anyone. My friend and I had also decided that if we could not find her an owner by February, we would send her to the SPCA. Unfortunately, Hanabi got into an accident a few days ago. Either she fell down really hard, or she got hit by a passing vehicle. Whatever the cause, she had temporarily lost control of her bowel movements, and her tail is dislocated. It will take us 2 weeks to see whether she can regain control of her bowel movements, but other than that she can walk, eat, jump, and still be the friendly kitten she is. Now, with these handicaps, even if my friend and I were to take her to the SPCA, the chances of her living past one week are near 0. I have heard that if a pet is not adopted within one week's time at a certain animal shelter, they put the pet to sleep to make room for others. People who do not know what a lovable kitten Hanabi is will not even think of adopting her. She is facing a loveless life at the Animal Shelter, or she is facing a death penalty in a couple of week's time. And my friend and I only have two weeks left as a deadline. We have both tried Facebook and emails, but so far the only things we have found are pity and sympathy, which doesn't help us solve Hanabi's problem. Therefore, I am appealing to all of you. If you are interested in giving poor Hanabi a home, or if you know of anyone who might be interested, please let me know. Ask around, ask your parents friends, ask your friend's friends. Hanabi has been vaccinated, but she had yet to be spayed. Her medical bill is paid by my friend and I. She is very lovable, and very active. She has also been potty trained, and recently she has shown to have regained control of her bowel movements.

Yesterday, my cousin found a stray dog behind her office who was crying in pain. She found out that he was unable to move and quickly send him to the vet. After all the x-rays, clearly it has suffered a broken backbone, most likely due to the impact from a hit and run event as it's quite severe. This caused him to be partially paralyzed. The vet has tried his best and advised her to consider putting it to sleep. She came to me and asked me to help her out and see if anyone would be willing to take him in and care for him. Both of us are unable to adopt him as we are both working and have hectic schedules. I am in the IT and the nature of my work is extremely hectic. Hence I am sure I will not have the time to take good care of him. We love dogs, and we refuse to put it to sleep at the time being at least until Monday. We have been contributing to its x-rays, medication, staying costs and etc. Putting him to sleep is the very last resort and we really do not wish for that to happen. We are doing the very best we can to save his life, we really wish we can. Please help...

It's really a bad time because I'm leaving to the Netherlands on 9th August, but hey, I can't leave her there when there's stray dogs running around. So it's been 3 weeks she's staying at my place and she's learnt how to use the litter box. I'd very much like her to find a loving family to continue to provide her with affection and care. She's very playful and her favourite toy is a wine cork tied to a string. After a long day's playing she'll fall asleep on your lap while you're watching TV or reading emails. Stroking her hair can be very relaxing and therapeutic after a long day. She'll open her eyes occasionally to check if everything's alright and fall asleep again. After Meow is fully recharged with adequate sleep and yummy in her belly, she can run around the house at the speed of light to prove herself worthy of another playing session.

2298,,29,307,0,1524,"Found wandering about in the neighborhood one day around Chinese New Year , Harry the white mixed breed, has since then been taken care of by some neighbours. Once we got to know Harry better, we gave him shelter and fed him as well. We found him to be a great guard dog whenever he is in the compound. Harry is docile and obedient, yet alert and watchful for strangers. He roams freely around the house's outer compound and does not make a mess. Harry loves to be around kids and the neighbours are friendly with him. He enjoys walks with the children and running with us when we go for our jogs. Due to his close proximity with us in the neighborhood, we got Harry vaccinated, neutered and dewormed. He is also regularly bathed and checked for fleas. The neighbour's kids would regularly clip his nails/claws and play with him. Harry takes dog biscuits and real meaty treats. Our neighbors are mostly with dogs or cats, a mix of different races and all with irregular working times. As we are worried for his well-being and safety, we have all agreed that Harry deserves a permanent home and a family who can care for him full time. We believe that Harry will make a great family dog and companion to his future owner. He would love an adopter with sufficient space to move around, someone to take him for walks and the occasional tummy rubs when possible. For those who would like to adopt Harry, do visit my profile and contact me through it. We will provide you with his harness, collar and leash for no extra charge :)",1,5,1,1,2,5,0,0.0,3,Harry,1,2,6f5c2fe62,4,1,3106,0.0,41336,2,1,1,1,0,279,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,cream,white,no color,1,1,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.0,1.11999993,11.600000000000001,0.504512688,0.9683443600000001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.2798510600000004,0.954219036,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.39641414,0.16614864000000001,0.0,0.0,1.27316208,0.10669572000000001,0.0,dogdog breedblack and whitesnoutphoto captiondog like mammalmonochrome photographymonochromestreet dogfont,black,darkslategrey,grey,mixed breed,not_recognized,0,0,0,0,0

Please, only adopt him if you are truly going to give him a good home, and not cage him up. He loves being free to roam around the house and will never step outside. He is fully domesticated. Is patient with children and loves pushing his head against your hand to ask you to pet him. Loves sleeping on and inside blankets ( please check your blankets before jumping on to the beds!!!) and will try his best to catch every lizard and cockroach he sees. He's a fantastic cat and I'm sure he will bring a lot of joy to the one who adopts him.. just like he has done for us :)",1,0,3,1,1,5,1,0.0,2,Sunrise,1,1,285806a87,10,1,5308,0.0,41326,0,2,2,1,0,223,1,4,1,0,1,1,1,golden,no color,no color,0,1,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22.6,2.07999987,26.0,0.0,0.0,0.627786832,0.733239088,2.386697548,2.2832289980000002,0.0,0.811071908,2.229767838,1.663307664,0.0,0.131119788,0.48810462000000004,1.689401742,0.6016235620000001,0.0,0.0,2.5757368880000002,catsmall to medium sized catswhiskerscat like mammalkittendomestic short haired catsnoutaegean cat,rosybrown,dimgrey,darkolivegreen,tabby,domestic long hair,0,0,0,0,0

2626,,24,292,0,1350,"This mama cat needs a new home (while she is a great cat I am really allergic to cats so am reaching my limit in allergic reactions already). Which sucks because if there was ever a cat to convert a dog person this would be the cat. I don't think she's too old, maybe 2 or 3 years at most. Extremely, extremely loving cat. She loves people and will follow you around like a dog. Her favorite thing ever is for you to pick her up like a baby and rub her tummy. Seriously. I included a photo of the position she drops to immediately if she thinks there's a chance for a belly rub. Does not bite or claw people. I have stepped on her tail before and she did not even make to bite or claw, merely meowed and moved away. She's on the small side for a cat and has really blue gorgeous eyes. Doesn't like sitting still for photos though. Clearly does not have the makings of an Internet celebrity cat, despite her good looks. Warning : if you do not manja her she will definitely demonstrate her Siamese yowling / meowing complaints. Would really prefer to home her as an indoor cat with an owner who is home a lot. Not sure how she is with other cats but she definitely is not a dog fan (she ran into my -a stranger's arms, when about to birth because there were stray dogs up the road).

2629,,24,265,0,1129,"Hi all. Maya is a medium hair female cat and just had 3 kittens, pictured here. We have too many cats in our small place, and we are running out of hands and money to take care of them. We've been wanting to get Maya to be neutered but she always end up pregnant first as she spends most of her time outdoors. We don't have the heart to keep her locked up in a cage. Anyway, we absolutely insist that the whole family is adopted. If we wait until the kittens are old enough to be weaned Maya would get pregnant again by that time. Please take them only if you do have the space for the whole family. The kittens are still very young, and I'm not sure if it's ok to bring them to a new house this early. You can reserve them and we can arrange the transfer a few weeks from now. The kittens are very pretty, one of them has a 'batik' pattern.

She'll follow you everywhere in the house once she's attached to you and she has the softest fur ever. She also emits small mews when she wants you to look at her and has a unique marking ( fur color ) like a mole on her upper left lip. Her entire fur coat is also of very unique Calico colors ( White , Cream & Chocolate ). She's also very very easy to look after. Spends most of her time looking out at the world from my balcony and loves to sleep and cuddle. -------------------------------------------------------------- Si Cookie amat ramah and ceria tapi dia segan dan sangat manja.

2798,,4,266,266,1493,"Adorable Fendi was found dazed and stumbling by the side of the street two months ago. I rushed this kitten to the vets by private only to be told she was simply suffering from young age. Fendi has white tabby ginger fur, struggles to walk and is almost blind two both eyes - giving her a ghoulish appearance. Fendi loves to talk non-stop! If you like a cat who loooves attention, this is the cat for you! She is very active, loves to play with her cat toys and is learning how to play with our other cats. She is very affectionate with people, though she usually doesn't sit still long enough to get petted. She loves to be around her people and talks until her people give her the attention she deserves. Fendi in our care have received: Shots, flea treatment, deworming, veterinary exam (very healthy), and FIV & FLV test done. Fendi is even looks bigger than a picture. To ensure the health and proper care, Fendi has been provided under private vet and nurses care for almost two months. Fendi waiting for a family that wants a little unpredictability in their lives, pouncing from hidden corners, and ambushing you from behind! The decision to adopt a pet must include  all members of your family. If you are trying to decide whether a pet is right for you, be mindful that pets do add to your daily responsibilities. For many, the benefits more than make up for the added costs and extra duties, but decide carefully for yourself, because being a pet guardian is a long-term commitment.",1,0,2,2,1,4,1,0.0,2,Fendi,1,2,7ed005178,3,1,5855,0.0,41401,1,1,2,1,1,269,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,yellow,white,no color,0,1,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.8,0.9599999400000001,12.0,0.0,0.0,0.25674743,0.0,1.10270716,1.047918826,0.0,0.7505806100000001,1.081624394,0.837853586,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.792756902,0.12177530000000002,0.0,0.0,1.191130344,catsmall to medium sized catswhiskerscat like mammaleyesnoutdomestic short haired catkittenfurpaw,grey,rosybrown,rosybrown,domestic short hair,domestic short hair,1,1,0,0,0

2878,,96,307,0,5273,"When my dad passed away last November, he left behind his precious, most-loved fur children, Gigi and Bobby, and little Ruby (a little puppy I rescued last July. My father offered to foster and eventually adopted her into his pack. Ruby's profile can be viewed here - ). Along with my dad’s dogs, I personally have a one-year puppy myself - Daisy Mae, making it a total of 4 dogs, and 12 cats I have under my care. We've been rescuing strays for as long as we can remember, and somehow, we've always found room for one more. My temporary solution in attempt to keep the family together was to continue to pay rent for my dad’s place so that his dogs would still have a home. Rental alone, not inclusive food and necessities for the dogs cost RM1, a month. On an average, with food and necessities, it probably easily sums up to RM/RM, and sometimes RM a month. While I’ve always believed that money can always be earned again, it’s also a hefty sum to cough out on a monthly basis for 3 dogs alone. My dad’s landlord is also keen on taking back the house, and have it rented out to new tenants. With that said, the clock is ticking for me. I have only until the end of February to look for new homes, or a solution for Gigi, Bobby, and Ruby. What I ideally want is to have these dogs under my care, because they were my dad’s babies. He loved them to bits. His whole life was about them - he took care of them exactly like his own children. When he saw that I was cooking for my pets, he did the same - he would cook for them and when he couldn’t, he would lavishly treat them to packets of chicken rice, fruits, and all sorts. Sometimes, their meals are even more lavish than his own. Gigi was his little princess. She was the first of the pack, adopted at about 6 months old. Everywhere my dad went, Gigi was right behind him. She’s very loyal and protective. Every night without fail, she would take her spot right beside my dad on his bed - sleeping only when he sleeps. She would occasionally try to steal kisses and belly rubs from my dad before bedtime. If my dad pretends to be asleep, she would nudge him repeatedly until he finally gives in, and gives her the belly rubs she wanted. Gigi is also very demanding in her own little adorable ways - she wouldn’t let my dad stay past his bedtime, and if my dad had visitors around, she would bark to remind him that bedtime was near. She wouldn’t take no for an answer. If he ignores her, she would continue to bug him until he gives up and goes to bed. Bobby is just a gentle old-soul. He had a family prior to this, and he lost his way one day. By fate, he ended up in front of my dad’s house. In the beginning, my dad didn’t want to take Bobby in, but because Bobby never left (he wandered the streets but every night, he would faithfully return to my dad’s house and slept right outside the gate) my dad eventually decided to adopt him two weeks later. We then found out that Bobby was fearful of many things, especially when you hold up certain objects in front of him - he would retreat with his head hung low, somewhat afraid that he might be hit. We suspected that he had been abused before. But my dad believed that there was nothing love and patience cannot cure, and he was right. In time, Bobby grew accustomed to him and trusted him (and Gigi) as his family. My dad’s life changed tremendously with the presence of Gigi and Bobby. Life was simple, but it was just so cheerful and so full of love. We’ve never been rich, and on some days, we had little to spare, but my dad had his ways, and he made sure that his fur kids were well taken care off. During the last few months of my dad’s life, he was in and out of the hospital for quite a bit, and each time he got admitted, the first thing he would do is to remind me to take good care of his children - to make sure that they are well fed, and are okay at home. Even as he was hooked up on all sorts of machines, he would think about them and about their well being, despite all the pain and discomfort he experienced. As I’m writing this right now, I feel so incredibly guilty and helpless for not being able to protect and preserve the most important ‘people’ in my dad’s life. But at the same time, I’m aware that realistically, I’m not able to make drastic changes in my life and get a bigger space that can accommodate 4 dogs under one roof. Presently, the space that I have just isn’t big enough to have everyone together, and I do not have animal-loving people as neighbours (which makes things even more difficult). So here I am, humbly seeking for your kindness and understanding, to know how much this means to me, and how important it is that I find good homes for my father’s dogs because I am unable to take care of them myself. I’m opened to trial adoptions, temporary fosterings - anything that can help in helping me find a new family for these loving fur kids. If you know of anyone who is interested/can help, I'd appreciate if you could please help spread the word. Thank you. *Gigi (female), Bobby (male), and Ruby (female) are spayed/neutered. *They are flexible as indoor and outdoor dogs. *We're not too sure of Gigi and Bobby's age - but as a rough estimate, they are about 6 - 8 years old.

2879,,6,266,0,1012,"Four adorable male kittens looking for loving homes. These four brothers were rescued from a drain when they were about a month old, with severe cat flu and eye infection. They have since recuperated, dewormed and received two vaccination jabs and are currently ready for neutering. These brothers are very close to each other - they eat, play, sleep together and we're hoping to find adopters who are willing to adopt them as a pair. They are all very playful and affectionate - Little Gray and Little Black especially, adores cuddling sessions with their humans. The only criteria for adopters is to bring the kittens for neutering prior to adopting them. You can either choose to neutering the kittens at your preferred veterinarian clinic, or we can recommend you to ours. There will be no adoption fee for these kittens. Vaccination card would be provided for keeping as well.

Currently my family is fostering her but as my mother is allergic to cats we really cannot keep her for long, we hope to find her a home that is loving and kind to her! She's very fluffy and very loving, she absolutely adores human affection and human attention. She eats a lot. Since I have found her within the week I have bathed her and used flea medicine on her. However as we did find her as a stray even though she suspect that she is a runaway additional charges will apply if we are to vaccine and spade her.

Otherwise, may bring them to SPCA after 2 weeks as we couldn't really keep them (if we do, we will have 5 dogs). Anyone would be able to help to look for a good permanent home for them? :)",2,0,1,2,1,7,0,0.0,2,Cute lil souls in need of new home,1,3,9854d0dbc,2,2,5597,0.0,41401,1,2,1,2,0,124,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,black,brown,yellow,0,0,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.0,0.79999995,10.0,0.0,0.74486532,0.0,0.70914148,0.18494454000000002,0.18118285,0.7475742400000001,0.52037552,0.751999078,0.0,0.5876832000000001,0.7320677600000001,0.18573002800000002,0.16157662,0.0,0.7367496,0.0,0.8241570960000001,dog breeddog like mammaldogdog breed groupcatpuppywhiskerscarnivoransnouttail,darkslategrey,grey,olivedrab,mixed breed,not_recognized,0,0,0,0,0

Some had died in the accident, some had been adopted to the lovely families, some are at the foster's home. This girl is very friendly, love to lick my face when I say 'kiss kiss'! Like to play, she is the master of the Tug of War game! And she is not human shy. She has been dewormed but not been vaccinated yet. We are still trying to find her a foster's place or even better the permanent house for at least a week before she can be vaccinated. Because whenever the young puppy is put to the new environment, he/she will be very frightened, anxious and caution. At this point his/her immune level will be very low - if we vaccinated him/her at this time, he/she will be easily get virus attack because of the low immune system. Nevertheless, she is a beautiful girl looking for the lovely, warm, care family who will love her unconditionally.

She has slight bleeding on her lip and lost a tooth. She may have been kicked by strangers. She is gentle, friendly and wears a blue HLBB collar. Will the owner please message me? Update : Hope (named her Hope) went to the vet today. She has microchip on her but does not show owners detail. Apparently it's doesn't show owners detail but just microchip number - and is common in Malaysia. She is currently suffering from cold and wheezing and is on medication now.

3002,,5,266,0,1939,"Little Olly is a five month old male cat. He has been neutered, vaccinated and de-wormed. I found little Olly behind my office with a broken leg (from an accident) covered with motor oil (hence the name) and mud. Although he didn’t resist me and sat quietly while I drove, I knew this little fellow was a fighter. After he had rested for a week (under the covers) only coming out to eat, his true spirit came out. This little fellow doesn’t give up. Despite his broken leg, he wanted to run around the house. Now all mended, he has turned out to be one of the most handsome kittens I have seen. A perfect combination of white and orange, he has beautiful orange fur on the top whilst his face down to this paws are white. Due to his accident he cant mew very much or very loud, but he makes up by rolling around your feet and head butting you all day. This little champ needs someone who can love him unconditionally as he has been through so much in his short life. He also needs a friend as he loves to play and ends up inviting you for a game all day. I would prefer my cats are kept as indoor cats with space to run around as they love to play. I am very strict about not caging my fur kids and hope you don’t cage them. Imprisoning them in a small cage is inhumane. Cats are curious animals who love to explore their surroundings. Give them space to walk and run around. I have given him his first vaccinations and expect their new parents to follow through with yearly vaccinations. Taking care of fur kids is easy. All they need is some food, lots of love & attention and they will be at your side all their life. Lastly it would be great if he has another partner to play with at home. If you do not have any, please consider adopting another cat. Cats are very social animals and it is healthier to adopt two so they can have another cat to play or interact with.

3003,,3,292,0,2411,"Ash is the handsome male in the house. He has perfect blue eyes like his buddy blue and a perfect brown nose. Ash`colours are lovely. Starts with a lovely white face and ends at his perfect long ringed brown raccoon tail. He is very playful and loving. First one to greet u at the door. He loves food. Games and his spot on the chair. Ashton has not been spayed due to his age. Spaying by the new family is compulsory at 6 months. Please consider adopting ash together with his friend blu as they are close friends and it is great entertainment to watch them play. Conditions: Indoor cats: I would prefer my cats are kept as indoor cats with space to run around and play. I am very strict about not caging my fur kids and hope you don’t cage them (unless required by vet). Cats are curious animals and are constantly exploring their surroundings. Give them space to walk and run around. But also remember to kitty proof your house. Good Quality Food: My cats are fed some sort of premium brands. Good quality food is important to maintain their health and more beneficial for you in the long run (less vet visits!) Companions: Cats are very social animals and it is healthier to adopt two so they can have another cat to play or interact with. Especially if you are busy at work or otherwise most of the day :). But if you can only get one cat, then please consider adopting an adult cat. Adult cats are usually litter box trained, spayed and easier to take care. Their personality is developed and you know what you get. They are also more independent and mellow in their games and spend a lot of time napping ;). Medical/vets: My cats are not spayed/neutered if less than 6 months. You must agree to do so at 6 months. You must also agree to give booster shots (if required) and yearly veterinary examination. Other Conditions: You will need to fill an adoption form when you adopt my cats. If you ever feel you can’t cope with them, they have to be returned to me. I love to receive updates on their progress with pictures. If you are travelling, i would like first right of refusal for taking care of them when you are away (depending on my schedule). Taking care of fur kids is easy. All they need is some food, lots of love & attention and they will be at your side all their life. But before adopting, please consider your financial situation.

You will never get bored watching this little one play. Sometimes she looks gold sometimes brown and sometimes gold& black. She is a fluffy cat with the softest fur. Although timid, she is also very gentle and friendly. She is a perfect lap cat cuddling on your lap for a nap and running to greet you after a long day. An interesting fact about tortoiseshell cats is In the folklore of many cultures, cats of the tortoiseshell coloration are believed to bring good luck.Dating back to Celtic times, tortoiseshell cats have been perceived to bring good fortune into their homes. Even today, the Irish and Scottish believe stray tortoiseshell cats bring them luck. In the United States, tortoiseshells are sometimes referred to as money cats.

3120,,1,266,0,1536,"4 days ago, Tiger was found on the street. When I first saw her, I couldn't believe my eyes to see this tiny angel jalan jalan on the road looking for food. She was so tiny to be recognized as a cat at first sight. I asked around the guards who are there on the street at all the times, he said she was there alone woundering around for 2 days. She is really a small angel and lovely character. Suprisingly, she wasn't afraid of people at all and even approched us for help. I took her to my house to give her food and shelter. It's really a shame that I can't keep this angel since I am expecting soon and having already 2 rescued cats at home now. So I really want to find her a good companion and loving home which she deserves so much. She is very bright and friendly character. She loves people!! Very healthy and able to use her liter box perfectly already. We did first deworming and her 2nd deworming and Vaccination will be 10 days from now. Condition for adopting Tiger: 1. About the adoption fee Rm, I have to know the person who is interested in Tiger will give her good life and support. You are very welcomed to donate this amount to pet finder instead and just show me the proves. 2. She is so small that we hope the person who adopts her will keep her as indoor pet only. 3. You have to have experiences living with animals. 4. Finically settled and stabilized. (Having a pet at home needs lots of commitment.) 5.

3126,,36,49,0,760,"Dong Dong is a well-trained yet playful girl. She has gone through few levels of training (Pre-Novice, Novice and Intermediate). She is a good indoor dog and never lives backyard or outdoor. She is microchipped and has a MKA certificate (but I lost the certificate). She could get along well with children but somehow will cause unintentionally injury to young kids (as bull terrier breed is active, it plays rough and has to be trained to be gentle) Hence, a family with young children is not suitable to keep her.

3152,,20,307,0,1346,"On the 8th Aug , Ubu Wong Choy was rescued after he was found lying by the pavement, helpless and in agony from a hit and run road accident. This poor furbaby had been through hell with a broken front right leg, two operations and three rods inserted. Now that our rescued Ubu has recovered, he is seeking for a forever home. Ubu is a sweet tempered and playful 1+ yo young dog. Despite his loving nature, he would serves as a good guard dog as he only barks at strangers or other dogs who come too close to the house gate. Otherwise, he barely makes a sound. Ubu is also very obedient and intelligent. He understand that he needs to go into the cage when fosterer drives out without being told or leashed. He is also toilet trained. He pees and poos only on grass but does not do so in house. So unless you have grassy compound, Ubu would need to be walked twice a day for nature calls. He is not aggressive and can be unleashed at parks as he will not attack other dogs, human/children. He would however show signs of resentment by growling if other dogs come too close. Most importantly, he is very friendly, safe and tolerant with rough toddlers. We hope you could give Ubu Wong Choy a chance to love and be loved. Kindly pm me or any of the tagged names if interested or at least click share to help this furbaby find a family.

That time, I didn't noticed that Julie is pregnant until I brought her home.

3178,,20,60,0,2454,"I am Peri's 3rd Owner. The story of how he was found was an interesting one. He was registered in Batu Caves, but was found abandoned in Kepong. The second owner took him in and fostered him in Seri Kembangan until he had his newborn child, and he no longer could keep pets due to his child, so I took him in and cared for him, I wanted to make him mine. When I took him in, I was running my own business so I had the luxury and time to care for him and provided him the best place a dog could wish for - a big garden with other dogs to run round and play with. This big garden wasn't mine, but a good friend's garden. Unfortunately, one day he injured his eye, and his right eye is % blind. Things didn't go well for all of us last year, I lost my business, my good friend moved out and Peri now stays in a 2 X 6 feet laundry area in my unit. I work long hours at the office and after office hours to repay my debt that I accumulated. I appeal to the future owner of Peri to please care for him for the rest of his life. As I feel that I am imprisoning such a beautiful dog that all he wants is a belly rub and a lovely owner to play with him, which I cannot afford to provide currently. Peri's personalities. >Smart >Loyal >Obedient >Very very Manja (can sleep beside you the whole night or when you’re watching a movie giving him his belly rub without moving) He loves belly rubs! He can run around in circles before he jumps on the sofa, only to flip over and ask for a belly rub which I guarantee you cannot resist giving. He loves a shower and being groomed. Not spoilt when it comes to food either. I feed him doggie biscuits and he is absolutely fine with it. He is very quiet. He only howls when he hears the police siren, other than that, very friendly with other dogs but funnily afraid of cats! He knows how to sit, give paw, in(to go into his crate),come and leave it commands. When I adopted him, he already knew how to sit and, give paw when there is food. I thought him the leave it,in, come command in 3 X 15 mins sessions, that’s how smart he is. Very easy to train! He loves his walks. I walk him from time to time when I have time. Very easy to walk and won't go after other dogs and provocations. To the future owner, if you wish to adopt him, I really hope that this will be the last owner change for Peri. I thank you for reading my post and considering adopting this very lovable dog. P.S - He responds very well to his name Peri.",1,0,2,1,1,4,0,0.0,1,Peri,1,2,83e756b85,5,1,746,0.0,41401,1,1,1,1,0,491,1,28,1,0,1,0,1,brown,white,no color,0,1,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,1.27999992,16.0,0.12420544,1.4684004000000002,0.0,0.7751705799999999,0.0,0.0,1.509579412,1.152613734,0.276611842,0.0,0.8330536340000001,1.438907136,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.5012691,0.0,0.0,dogdog breeddog like mammaldog breed groupchihuahuapuppyearsnoutcarnivorancompanion dog,grey,rosybrown,darkgrey,chihuahua,not_recognized,1,0,0,0,0

Clearly, someone irresponsible abandoned it there, as I checked the dog, estimated several weeks old, female, and it's tail has been cut since birth. I nearly ran over it, and if I don't pick it up I can't imagine what could possibly happen to an innocent little dog. I already have 2 dogs in the house, and now I am looking for anyone who is highly responsible to provide this cute and adorable puppy a new home.

3212,,36,264,0,4721,"I'm opening this profile on behalf on my sis who is currently dealing with a serious medical condition which has left her financially unable and time poor to continue taking care of her cats that she's had for the past 3 years or so. Reluctantly she has decided to put 5 of her cats for adoption. They are all long hair cats. 2 of them are of Persian breed but with no cert, they're termed as DLH :) The following are details of the cats:- 1) Kiki Gender : Female Age : 2 years Size : Small Colour : Black/Brown Type : DLH-Persian peke faced breed Personality Kiki is tame and friendly. She needs extra care and attention as she is actually from Persian peke faced breed. Which means she's very flatfaced. Her eyes water a lot, needs daily wiping and since she's very flatfaced, she needs constant wiping around the eyes, mouth and nose area. 2) Bibi Gender : Male Age : 3 years Size : Medium Colour : Blue aka Gray Type : DLH-Persian flatface parentage Personality Bibi is friendly, will answer when called :) Very active and playful i.e will jump and prance around house. Not for the faint hearted. LOL 3) Chubaka Gender : Male Age : 3 years Size : Large Colour : Brown Tabby Type : DLH Personality Chubaka is similar to Bibi. Friendly and very playful. But he's large :P 4) Sylvester Gender : Female Age : 1 year Size : Medium Colour : Solid Blue Type : DLH Personality Sylvester is the offspring of Kiki and Bibi. Friendly. tame and likes being brushed. And my personal favorite...Don't ask me why she was named Sylvester! LOL! 4) Mocha Gender : Female Age : 1 year Size : Medium Colour : Brown Tabby Type : DLH Personality Mocha and Sylvester are from the same litter by Kiki. We believe they were sired by either Bibi or Chubaka or both :P Like Sylvester, Mocha is also friendly and tame. Note :- All of these cats are not in their optimum condition due to lack of time and financial ability to care of them. Almost all of them have minor fungus and loss of fur due to shedding, Mocha especially. She now looks like a lion i.e fur around the head but thinning on the body. They live in a big cage in the backyard since my sis' 2 yo daughter is allergic to fur. Our humid weather and lack of human attention which leads to stress could also be a contribution factor to their condition. Requirements Kiki, Bibi and Chubaka were both purchased at a price of between RM to 2.2K. Not that it makes them extra special vs any other cats, but it just means that we are seriously looking for people who love cats and are able to provide what my sis can't without selling them... 1) Adopter must have a household income therefore financially able to provide food and litter plus medical care. They're currently on Iams. So no less than that. Must use proper litter, no newspaper please. They're used to clumping clay based litter (i'm not sure of brand). They will need immediate medical attention for their fungus, possible earmites, vaccinations and deworming. Bibi and Kiki have had their kitten vaccinations but not adult. The others have not been vaccinated. 2) We would like for an adopter who already has at least one cat if adopting just one of them because they have all lived together all their lives so being alone will be stressful for them. Adopting more then one is welcomed provided adopter meets the requirements. However we would prefer a household with maximum 5 cats. These cats have not had enough human contact or free roam play time hence I'd like to ensure that adopters are able to give them a lot at attention and free space to roam. 3) Specifically for Kiki, we require an adopter who is experienced caring for a flatfaced Persian. 4) The adopter must ensure the cats receive a lot of attention which includes playtime and grooming (since they're DLH, daily brushing is best) and lots of love obviously :). 5) The cats must not be caged as they've been caged enough unless it is for their own safety and for a minimum amount of time. They must also be strictly kept indoors. 6) As mentioned, the cats are not in very good condition so immediate vet visit is a must and costs to be born by adopters. 7) Preference will be given to adopters who support neutering/spaying the cats to ensure the health of the cats and also to ensure they don't end up being commercialised or contribute to stray problems. 8). We would prefer adopters who are in Klang Valley and would appreciate if adopters are ok with ocassional visits by us. We will feel much better seeing the cats happy at their new homes and I'm sure my sis and hubby will miss these furkids when they leave... We require an adoption fee of RM to ensure that adopters are serious about the cats.

3276,,12,307,0,889,"I'm Emilie Bobbi Brown. I got these names while I was wandering at the street and my current fosterer composed them into my name. I used to hide under cars for shade, had some conversation with neighbours' dogs, begging for food and water. It was the first time a human touched me and I never felt such warmth in my life. I followed her home and she offered me some food, shelter and company. ***** We found Emilie wandering around the neighbourhood and her origin is unknown, suspecting it is another abandon case. She still has trust in human and is approachable at that time. We took her in and spayed her. We realized Emilie is a very loyal one. She waits for us every evening, and greet us gently when we arrived home. She is a timid dog, but we can see she has her mischievous side when she got a toy to play with. Currently, she is recovered from spaying and is ready to be adopted.",1,0,1,2,1,4,0,0.0,2,Emilie Bobbi Brown,1,3,9c60c63f6,8,1,1850,0.0,41326,0,1,1,1,2,168,2,1,1,0,0,1,1,brown,cream,white,0,1,1,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.4,1.75999989,22.0,1.0189809,1.516733498,0.0,0.61444158,0.0,0.0,2.0201677680000003,1.7044510560000001,0.10081288,0.0,0.0,1.2266782000000003,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.064358124,0.0,0.0,dogdog breeddog like mammalsnoutwhippetstreet dogitalian greyhounddog breed grouphoundcarnivoran,black,darkslategrey,rosybrown,mixed breed,not_recognized,0,0,0,0,0

Turns out it was not, but we took her home and foster her because we suspected she was either lost or abandoned pet. A few days later, my own dog was found ! Unfortunately we could not keep both as both dogs could not get along at all. We could not locate her owner too, so we have no choice but to give her up for adoption. Appreciate someone could provide her a loving home to this poor doggie, she would make a lovely companion. She would also need a patient owner as she has some skin problem which I think could be solved by taking some supplement and good food.

They are adorable and fluffy and love playing with each other and surrounding objects like bag straps, towels, slippers and tissue paper. They are all litter trained and eat both wet and dry food now. Unfortunately I cannot afford to take care of them all so I have to give them for adoption. I hope they can find a wonderful forever home. Shiro is a beautiful kitten who loves playing with his siblings. He also enjoys a good nap and easily falls asleep when you hold him in your hand. He also loves sleeping on bags. James is the oldest one and is quite fluffy. He is very playful and loves to cuddle up next to you. He also loves exploring around the house and likes to sleep on bags and slippers. He loves climbing up on chairs and bags and loves food. Lily is the youngest one and is the only female. She is very beautiful and has a very pink belly. She loves sleeping on top of clothes and loves rolling in the sunlight. She also loves sleeping on top of suitcases and cuddles up in the blanket.

3366,,84,307,307,4327,"Laika’s story: Laika’s story with our family began in a busy supermarket car park in Miri, Sarawak. She was probably little more than a year old, heavily pregnant, and living off scraps from a nearby hawker stall and goodies that people doing their shopping would buy for her. She wasn’t very keen to come home with us – she preferred to keep humans at a safe distance back then – but we managed to persuade her with some chicken pieces. She promptly vomited these up over me, my husband and the back seat of his company car on the drive home. A week later Laika gave birth to five beautiful puppies in a sunny corner of our home. She was still very wary of both me and my husband but she needed our help with her puppies and gradually started to trust us. She was a wonderful mother and was constantly looking after and looking out for her five energetic and demanding babies. With the help of the PAWS network in Miri we were able to find five good homes for the puppies, but Laika stayed on with us. This wasn’t a straightforward decision. We already had a dog and two cats and we thought carefully about the repsonsibility and cost of taking on another pet when we were certain our future would involve further travel and postings abroad in different countries. We didn’t know Laika’s background but her wariness around people and an injury on her front paw suggested she hadn’t had an easy start to life. But she had come to trust and depend on us and we had grown very attached to her. With her puppies rehomed and her mothering responsibilities over we got to know Laika better. She liked to go for walks and adapted quickly to walking in a harness and on a leash, but she loved being off the leash and running along the local beach, usually at quite amazing speeds. She loved being around us and would sit quite happily at our feet while we worked or watched TV or follow us around the house from room to room. She loved being stroked, especially on her tummy. You could fuss over her for hours and she wouldn’t get bored. And she loved food and was always a little worried about where the next meal was coming from or whether she could gobble up her dinner before someone else got to it. She got along well with our cats and, after a few disagreements over food, became friends with our other dog. She is still sometimes a little unnerved by sudden movements or excited squeals from our three year old daughter, but this has never caused us any significant concern. We also learned that she didn’t like loud noises or crowds and would pull out her harness if we came across a large group of children playing in the street. She became very nervous if people approached her on the street and it took time for visitors to the house to gain her trust. She was completely disinterested in playing ball or fetching sticks. She only chewed things when she was stressed or upset. After our first long holiday apart from her we came home to find an apologetic pet minder and the contents of the bottom row of our bookshelf in shreds on the rug. She’d demonstrated her displeasure at being left behind by chewing her way through half of the complete works of Charles Dickens. And we’d never got round to reading them first. We are heartbroken that we may lose Laika from our family. Although she is healthy and active, New Zealand Bio Security has denied her entry to the country because she has tested positive to having had Babesia Gibsoni (a variety of tic fever) at some time in her life. Even though the tests show she has fully recovered, the fact that she had it in her past, is enough to bar her from entry into NZ or Australia. We are having the tests repeated to ensure there was no mix up in the samples and are still hoping against hope that there may be some way around this problem, but are preparing ourselves for the worst. We would love to find Laika a loving home if we are unable to take her with us. She is a wonderful pet. She is loving and loyal and the perfect companion and will be your loving shadow when you are with her. As I write this she is curled up behind my chair and if I whisper her name I will receive an answering flick or two from her tail. Please help. I have never been more attached to a dog or more sure that she will bring huge joy to anyone who can offer her a loving home.

3375,,3,141,307,2488,"Brann (male) & Arya (female) were rescued 2 months ago from a drain. It was rainy season so we rescued them in fear that they might drown. The pictures shown were taken when they got their first vaccination at the vet. At the time, they were only 2.5 months old (verified by the vet). They may not seem like it because of their larger size, the vet believes they may be from a bigger breed. They are now 3 months old and I think it would be nice for them to have a new family that they can bond with from this early age. I have tried to get them neutered and spayed, but no vet would do it as they are too young. If you are looking for additional family members, please consider them. They are easily trained, very smart and listen well. Bear in mind though, they are still puppies. They like to play a lot but very manja at the same time. They must be adopted together. They know their names and will come when called. They know the commands ""sit"", ""down"" and ""off"". They play fetch the ball too! My conditions are: 1. Landed house with a patch of grass (for their toilet), with secured fencing so the puppies do not escape. They are not suitable for apartments. 2. Adopter has a chance for a trial period of 2 weeks. If the adopter feel the puppies are not a good match with their family, they can return after the trial period. At the same time, if I feel the adopter and puppies are not good match, I will have the right to reclaim them. This is to ensure both adopter and puppies will be happy in the long term, as this is a lifelong commitment. 3. Adopter must provide good food (they eat meatdust and sometimes kibbles) and water that is changed daily. 4. Adopter must provide a living space that is humane, not too hot and has shelter from the sun and rain. The dogs must not be caged and not tied up for long periods of time. 5. Adopter must promise to complete the 2nd and 3rd monthly vaccination (1st has been done by me) and then once yearly. If this happens during trial period, I will pick them up and get it done. 6. Confirmed adopter must promise to spay/neuter the puppies when they are 5 months old. If there is a problem, contact me and I will help you get this done and I will bear the cost. At this time, the puppies are cared for by a relative and so I apologize it is not possible to visit them. But I can bring them to you if you'd like to meet them. I live in Subang Jaya and any location around Klang Valley would be okay.

3377,,12,75,119,1791,"Location: Subang Jaya Choco is young, only a year old, and is very active. She is very smart, I taught her how to fetch in only one day and she grasped it fast (as shown in video). She is dauschund-husky mix, very small build, but tall. Her owner was a neighbor who moved back to their homecountry, Korea. So I offered to take care of her till I can find her a new family. She is better suited for a family with landed property with a grass patch (she does her toilet business on grass), and with another young dog to play with. She can easily get lonely without another dog or person to play with, and sometimes her anxiety leads to not eating. She's a dog trainer's dream come true because she is very eager to learn and she does learn fast, with treats as motivator. If you are looking for a young dog who is matured enough and can easily be moulded through training from young, she is the one. Unfortunately I do not have the time to bring out the best in her. Choco is vaccinated, microchipped, spayed and dewormed and professional grooming. Adopter will be given her Pet Passport with her microchip serial number and medical details. Adopter will given a trial period of 2 weeks, after which if you are not happy with Choco, you may return her to me, or if I feel it is not a good home for Choco, I will take her back (fee reimbursed in either case). This is because I want to make sure the family and dog will match. If the trial period passes successfully, the adopter must allow me to visit (with prior appointment) a few times till both sides are happy. I apologize, I am not trying to make the procedure difficult - I just want the dog and family to be happy as this is at least a 10 year commitment. Please call or sms (Winnie) if you are interested in becoming Choco's guardian.",1,0,2,2,1,4,1,0.0,2,Choco-young-smart!,1,2,16a43d1b1,5,1,388,0.0,41326,0,1,1,1,1,339,3,33,1,0,0,1,0,black,golden,no color,0,1,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.0,1.27999992,16.0,0.0,1.5262585180000001,0.0,0.7344235160000001,0.0,0.0,1.5027750560000002,0.669224668,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.3934104820000002,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.5699162800000002,0.0,0.0,dogdog like mammaldog breedgerman shepherd dogdog breed grouppinscherdobermannsnoutcarnivoranvulnerable native breeds,black,grey,silver,dachshund,husky,0,0,1,0,0

She's the most ""manja"" of the 4 - loves getting attention and cuddles, will climb on your lap to ask for it. When you pick her up, she purrs alot.

You could say she rescued herself! That was 2 weeks ago. I have never seen such a friendly kitten; she purrs like a motorboat on overdrive, loves being pet, meows for attention and would not hesitate to jump on your lap! In fact, she was purring away in my car and clambering over my lap/ chest for attention even before I reach home! She is dewormed, washed and given Frontline spray. She was a quite thin but has since put on some weight. She is also litter-trained (self trained... huhuhu). Every time I walk close to her she will meow her acknowledgement (or meow wanting to be pet... hehehe) While healthy, she hobbles along as there seems to be a problem with her left paw. The vet says she has probably suffered an accident which causes her to walk on her 'ankle'. But come play time, she will still bat and attack the mouse-on-a-string toy. I have too many cats to take care of another, though I can assure any new adopter that she doesn't seem to require any special attention. She can be active and jump onto my bed or sofa or explore the house. Please consider giving her a new home and she will love you back many times over.

3476,,90,188,307,1417,"He was dumped as a puppy in a factory lot in Kota Damansara in . A nice security guard looked out for him for a few days till he came home to live with us. That was his first soft toy – it was bigger than Tag when we first met him. Tag is now 7+ years old, athletic in physique and weighs 30kgs. He eats dry dog food, doggie treats, the occasional table food and is crazy over durian. Tag is a Rhodesian Ridgeback Mix and has been trained and socialised. He loves to play and has a basket full of toys. He is friendly, cheeky, happy and smiley. Tag is quite the kepochi – curious and communicative. A good guard dog. Tag is like a real-life Scooby Doo. Very loyal and affectionate. He is a bit of a chicken too when it comes to thunder and fireworks. He also dislikes motorbikes and the Vet. He is a waterdog, obedient and enjoys the company of humans and other dogs. Tag loves his toys, and is up for a game of fetch even when half asleep. He is also a huge fan of car rides. Tag is a VERY loved dog. The reason he needs a foster home is because his only family member is going back to university for 4 years and sadly there are no pet-friendly student accommodation options available. It is an extremely difficult and tear inducing decision. We are both so attached to each other but sadly this seems the only option. If you are keen or know someone who would like to give Tag a happy home please send me a message.",1,100,1,1,1,4,1,0.0,3,Tag,1,1,f5ad400b7,2,1,4540,0.0,41326,0,1,1,1,0,277,1,96,1,0,1,0,1,brown,no color,no color,1,1,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.6000000000000005,0.79999995,10.0,0.0,0.8514126120000001,0.0,0.57771425,0.0,0.0,0.9002870000000001,0.7241760620000001,0.11133328,0.0,0.4301336,0.14978524000000001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.96775357,0.10113756000000002,0.0,dogdog breeddog like mammalsnoutcarnivoranplaypuppy,darkkhaki,sienna,steelblue,rhodesian ridgeback,mixed breed,0,0,0,0,0

She looks like an abandoned case as she is super friendly and want to be pet all the time sitting in one place waiting.I took her to the vet for checkups, she has lost most of her teeth which makes it difficult for her to find food on her own.

Its sad to give them away but we hope they will find a good family ! Call me if you are interest to adopt them. Sorry to say that We are selective on the new owner thus its not for petshop or breeder! ------------ Some info on Ragdoll : History In the family of cat breeds, Ragdolls are among the younger siblings. The cats were first developed by breeder Ann Baker in Riverside, California, in the s. Baker’s foundation stock consisted of Josephine, a domestic longhair whose white coat concealed the genes for either a seal mitted or black tuxedo pattern, and various other longhaired cats of unknown ancestry that she owned or found in her neighborhood. Baker selected for cats with gentle, placid personalities, large size, and beautiful long coats characterized by a Himalayan pattern, the name for the “points” seen on Siamese-type cats. The result was a cat she called the Ragdoll, for its propensity to flop happily into the arms of anyone who picked it up. Later, Persians, Birmans and Burmese may also have contributed to the Ragdoll’s development. Baker made many unusual claims about the cats’ development, including alien influence, CIA experiments, and infusions of human genes, but that is all they are: claims, with no basis in fact. Other people had begun breeding Ragdolls as well. They broke away from Baker and formed the Ragdoll Fanciers Club International, with the goal of standardizing the breed and achieving recognition by cat registries. The Cat Fanciers Association began registering the cats in and gave them full recognition in . Most registries now recognize the breed, including the American Cat Fanciers Association and The International Cat Association. Ragdolls are not outcrossed to any other breeds.

Vet said: - Normal wound on head. - Eyes is okay. - Need to leave the cat for boarding for abt 3 days before surgery. I seriously cant afford it. What should I do? Mom will let the cat go if I cant find anyone to help the cat soon. I have had enough fight on first Ramadhan with her since last night. So I'm begging you, anyone out there pleasee help this cat. I dont want my mother to let it go before it is treated but who am I to say that to her... m(_ _)m full detail/story: ----------UPDATE /------------ Salam, peopleee, GOOD NEWS \(^0^)/ *dances in circles* Orange survived! Surgery is a success! He made it! yayyyyy. ehem, ok Alhamdulillah. Sha baru call doctor. ape yg die cakap 1) orange is lookin good and very easy on himself. he meow when people come, resting in his cage lepak-lepak, eat pee n poo by himself. 2) the cost wouldnt be too much macam doctor expect since we didnt do the jaw surgery. it'll only be expensive if we keep him longer dekat sane. it is estimated to be around rm1k paling mahal pun 1.5k. gulp but better than RM 2k-3k kan? :) need to go to the clinic dulu then he'll discuss again about the total cost. now the problem: 1) orange is definitely tak biasa dengan org. so kena go slow dengan die, bagi die manje2 n trust orang. 2) so far, donation belum masuk dari mane2. so sha rasa kena somehow pinjam mana-mana dulu *thinks hard* 3) tak tahu lagi bila nak ambil Orange since next week I'll be so busy nak ulang alik pegi college and office I hope and pray that the potential adopter will accept Orange even for a little while, sementara nak bagi Orange fully recover. ----------MORE UPDATES /------------ and Dr.Teoh called me again just now, as for today, the total cost would be: RM++. but he tried omitting few charges and it became: RM, but he decided only RM! (but for today lah. the hospitalization will increase RM25 everyday) DOCTORRRRRRRRRRR THANKKK YOUUUUU. ----------- UPDATE ----------------- Orange was safely brought home today by his fosterer. We had another meet up at the vet. From what I have concluded: 1) For now Orange is still in a good condition: he eats (A LOT), his kidney is working well, the surgery sticthes have been removed and healed. 2) Dr.Teoh said, despite trying his best to bond with Orange, he found that Orange is a veryVERYY solitary cat. Cant blame him, doctor said he pity Orange.. since Orange is like very empty without any feeling. Might be because of his past/trauma, he's very terrified that he chose to isolate himself. He only meow when he wants food. 3) Orange might hiss hiss but he never bites. There was once where he attempts to bite the doc but due to the loss of his front teeth, no harm done, its not painful even by a BIT. XD;; 4) The wound however, will continue to spread and its getting bigger day by day. On the final stage, it'll spread to his lungs and that is when we'll need to PTS Orange :( (here still hoping there'll be some sort of miracle) [UPDATE ] YAYY new photo of Orange! So far Orange is stable. We can't do much for him since the wound are cancerous & incurable :( But we can still showers Orange with lots & lots of love & care & provide him comfort. Too bad we cant take out the collar since we're afraid that he'll scratch the wound and make it worse. ^^;; Be strong Orange! Live your life to the fullest, love. And we'll definitely continue to pray for you for sure! :)",3,0,1,1,3,12,0,0.0,2,Injured-Cat-Needs-A-Saviour,1,1,9967c6cb6,12,1,3603,0.0,41401,1,3,2,3,0,743,1,2,1,0,0,1,1,yellow,no color,no color,0,1,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,24.0,2.39999985,29.8,0.0,0.9000169600000001,0.11270534000000001,0.6482076800000001,0.7124597080000001,0.6398746460000001,0.0,0.6372692360000001,0.9580514320000001,0.13068374000000002,0.0,0.718272182,1.068669578,0.37503109,0.0,0.7401890720000001,0.0,0.9191823440000001,dog like mammaldogmammalanimal shelterdog cratecagekennelcarnivoranproductdog breed group,darkgrey,rosybrown,grey,domestic short hair,not_recognized,0,0,0,0,0

She is an odd-eyed medium/long fur white cat. Odd eyed = one blue eye one yellow eye. She is very friendly. She also like petting, and won't bite you even if you give her tummy rubs. She is litter-trained. We are not sure whether she is vaccinated, dewormed, or sprayed. She is quite skinny for now. We already have a cat and not planning on adopting another cat for now.

They are all in good healthy condition and currently are going thru the weaning period, and also whereby they are at the stage where they are starting to socialize with the world. This is a good a crucial stage to see them develop and is it also a good time to give them up for adoption as this will be easy for them to adopt to new environment and socialize with new owner and people. The daddy or culprit is and pure breed boxer. Attached will be some pictures of the pup and their parents. There are 4 male pups and 3 female pups for adoption. By the 8th week all the pups will need to have their vaccinations and I leave it up to the new owners to decide if they want their pups spayed or neutered. Last note, I'm hoping that these pups will find a loving home. Please do PM or Call me if you have any quires or if you are interested to adopt this Boxer, Mixed Bread Puppies!

From the sound it makes when meowing, I think it's a male, about 3 months old and already able to take solid foods. Very manja, likes to be around people, very playful & active.

I would like to find a good forever home for this little fella as I already have a pet cat that does not like any additions to the cat numbers at my home. Cempedak would make a good pet as he's comfortable around people and has a way of rubbing against you that makes your heart melt.

I actually in rush searching for adopter for these 3 little kittens which are specifically chosen color white, orange and one tortoiseshell like the mother of kittens. I can’t barely takecare of them since its six total of them including the mother. It’s too late for me to spay the mama until it got pregnant first and now the kittens already one month old. I put some payment so that I know like you really want to takecare of them.

But as soon as she becomes comfortable to you,she will want to start playing with you. She's toilet trained and very clean. She does not like uncleanliness. She won't poop when her toilet pad is very dirty. I tried many times to fatten her up,but still she looks very skinny. I think she's the skinny type. I rescued her near the longkang when she was 3 or 4 weeks old. I cared for her up until now when she's 1 yr old. Right now I cant take care of her because I'm moving house. I hope whoever that can provide a good home environment and can care and love her very much to take her plssssss... Because no one can take care of her now.

So as to avoid from frightening my neighbor and before anything happen to the dog, ended up I let him come inside to my car pouch to give him food, water then shower him too. Now it has been the 5th days, we can't stand the excessive barking which disturb my 3 dogs, my neighbor and their dogs too. I'm afraid one day my neighbor will call MPSJ and take away the dog. Therefore, I seek for your URGENT HELP to kindly share this to all to find if anyone is willing to adopt him quickly. He is a male dog in full body black shinny coat. He is friendly, happy, playful and wants attention. Suitable for those who want to keep a mature dog as a companion and can spend time to walk and play with him. Unfortunately I can't take him as my pack anymore but just foster him temporarily so that he is not in hunger and have a shelter. Appreciate your kind help to give this dog a chance to have a home.

She was a stray puppy few years ago around my neighbourhood here. Then, an old auntie adopted her. Unfortunately this old auntie is getting older & older, and she is not very well now.

They belong to relatives who live in Bukit Mertajam and can't afford/bother to do anything about the situation; I live abroad but am finishing a visit at the time of writing. Enough about me; on to the puppies: They're all related to each other, though only two are actually sisters. All three have the good-natured golden retriever temperament; the sisters (Masha and Irina!) have also inherited the breed's confidence and endearing shamelessness, while the other (Olga!) is rather shy, but warms up with familiarity. I've listed the adoption fee as 0, but will likely charge something to defray expenses for spaying and such (I'll be probably help their current owners foot the costs...). Of course, not gonna lie, the more the adopter can chip in the better... If interested, please email or WhatsApp me at the number listed on my profile.

She is, however, very protective once she acknowledges you and is an extremely good guard dog, she has got a good strong bark and listens to commands relatively well. You can walk her off leash after she has gotten used to you and the surrounding (at guarded areas and only if the people in your area are fine with it). We were originally thinking of keeping her for ourselves but we've already got a handful from our current dog, so we wish to find her a happier home where she can run free in or out.

3793,,36,307,0,1595,"Bailey was adopted by us. She is a sweet dog, great with children, undemanding and easy to maintain (she doesn't require grooming). She is an outdoor (yard) dog. She is trained to pee and poop only outside once a day on a walk. She isn't destructive. She's a great house ""alarm"" - very alert when strangers pass by, but has never bitten anyone (barks but doesn't advance to attack). Before her adoption in , she was an abused pup (abused by people and other dogs). She hides and is very timid when new people approach her. Therefore, it takes a few weeks for her to ""come out of her shell"" with new company, in a new environment. Once she becomes comfortable and trusts her new family, she is very friendly, playful and loving. Sadly, we need to put her up for adoption because we have moved into a condo which doesn't allow pets. Bailey has been a huge blessing to us as a family. She is great around young children (my youngest is 4 now, in total we have 4 kids under 11), she has never jumped on them or nipped them. They can touch her, pull her, grab her , hug her and stroke her without resistance. She has a very calm disposition. If your heart is big enough to accept and adopt an abused dog who just needs some extra patience and love in the beginning, you will be greatly rewarded by her doggy love and friendship! Currently, she is fed once a day, a bowl of kibble. When she lived with us, she was on a % RAW diet with no problems. As we have moved, we have brought Bailey to live with her original Fosterer.

He don't like people touching his bowl when he's eating, and he will bite strangers. Other than that, he is well behaved if family or friends (or even maid) are properly introduced. He is a lovely dog who always want to be with the people who feed him, walk side by side with the care taker. A protective dog. My family can't afford him anymore as we have 3 more dogs in the house.

3874,,24,266,0,993,I’m currently residing in Kota Kinabalu however my dear pets are still in KL looking for a new home. At the moment a friend of mine is helping me cat-sit until i find a new owner. I rescued both of them when they were still frail little kittens and nursed them back to health. They both are now fully grown cat adults and with the heaviest of heart I need to let them go due to relocation. Both Grey and Pumpkin are very docile and not prone to any aggresive behaviours. They are friendly and loves attention. Both love affection once they are used to you. I would prefer to have them adopted as a pair as I worry they will get lonely or miss each other. Pumpkin is neutered however Grey is not due to financial constrictions faced while relocating. I can arrange for her to be spayed or you may also do it in your own clinic. Fee can be waived. I will also give their two large litter boxes as well as a medium sized carrier. Please be a true cat lover if you are considering them.

3887,,60,266,0,870,"I found Lil' Kittie wandering around Cyberjaya one evening after work.While she was alert and friendly she did not look well. So I took her to the vet and it was discovered that she had a bad case of Pyometra. She had a hysterectomy and she recovered very well. Lil' Kittie has lived with me for the last 5 years. She is extremely timid. She is very shy with new people and very tentative with new cats. She has to get to know someone before she shows her lovable and affectionate nature. Once she has bonded, she becomes a very ""talkative"" and affectionate cat. However her talkativeness does not include yowling or wailing. Most of her conversation is taken up by mewing and purring. I am moving overseas next year and due to lack of resources, I will not be able to take her with me. Hopefully someone out there is looking for a affectionate and talkative cat friend.",1,0,1,2,1,4,0,0.0,2,Lil' Kittie,1,1,1572bf9cc,4,1,3883,0.0,41401,1,1,2,1,0,159,1,2,1,0,1,1,1,gray,no color,no color,0,1,0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.8,1.11999993,14.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.12248158,1.289892784,1.25441401,0.0,0.0,1.0838315840000001,0.9447354440000001,0.0,0.0,1.030961948,0.10062462000000001,0.930818408,0.0,0.0,1.3885353120000001,catmammalsmall to medium sized catscat like mammaldragon lifaunadomestic short haired catwhiskerseuropean shorthaircalifornia spangled,grey,darkolivegreen,darkolivegreen,domestic short hair,not_recognized,1,0,0,0,0

3901,,3,266,0,851,"I found Pip on the side of the road while out jogging. She was starving, and had a limp. Likely she had been born in an abandoned house in the area, and had been struggling to survive since. Since her first vet visit, she has been eating well an putting on weight. She is active, and a very curious kitty! However, she is also a total lap cat (when she's not doing laps around the house) and is perfectly content to cuddle up and watch a movie with you. Important info: 1. I am adamant that she be spayed. If the adopter is financially unable to pay the vet's fees for the procedure, I will sponsor the fees. 2. The vet has informed me that her limp is permanent - likely due to an injury that occurred either at birth or at a young age - and may or may not get better over time.
